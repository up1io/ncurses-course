# NCurses Course

This repo is a collection of small [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) code examples to explore the capabilities of ncurses.

> Please note that this repo reflects my learning purposes of ncurses, 
> not all code examples are 100% in the matter of best pratices. 
> So keep that in mind when reading the code.
